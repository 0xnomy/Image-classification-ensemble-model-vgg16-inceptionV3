## Introduction
This project involves the classification of images into four categories: Jerry, Tom, None, and Both. We use transfer learning with InceptionV3 and VGG16 models for this purpose.

## Data Preprocessing
- Setting constraints and loading dataset.
- Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.
- Displaying sample images and class distribution.

## Model Training
We trained two models: InceptionV3 and VGG16. Both models were fine-tuned on our custom dataset.


## Results
- The models achieved the following accuracies:
  - InceptionV3: Training Accuracy - 85.40%, Validation Accuracy - 71.14%
  - VGG16: Training Accuracy - 99.79%, Validation Accuracy - 83.84%

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in image classification tasks. By leveraging pre-trained models like InceptionV3 and VGG16, we achieved high accuracy in classifying images of Tom and Jerry characters.
